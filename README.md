<h1>Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</h1>
<img width="165" height="165" src="https://github.com/DerekPascarella/CastlevaniaSymphonyoftheNight-8BitDoDIYKitPatchSaturn/blob/main/images/cover.png?raw=true" align="right">A patch to change the map display button combination in the "v1.1 Ultimate" English translation patch of "Castlevania: Symphony of the Night" so that it functions with the 8BitDo DIY Controller Kit for the SEGA Saturn.
<br><br>
Note that this patch is meant to be applied to the <a href="https://meduza-team.ucoz.net/news/obnovlenie_dracula_x_nocturne_in_the_moonlight_ultimate_sega_saturn/2024-02-25-49">v1.1 Ultimate</a> patch in order to change the button combination used to display the in-game map. By default, the original patch uses Up+Start as the shortcut, which is unfortunately a reserved hotkey on the <a href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-mod-kit-for-original-sega-saturn-controller">8BitDo DIY SEGA Saturn controller kit</a>. After applying this fix, the combination Left+Start is now used as the map shortcut. Please understand that Down+Start was considered as the logical alternative, however although undocumented, this is a reserved hotkey on the kit as well.
